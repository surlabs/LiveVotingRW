# LiveVoting Repository Object Plugin for ILIAS 8 (Beta)
## **This plugin is on public Beta since 23.07.2024**
This plugin allows to create real time votings within ILIAS.
It is compatible with the previous LiveVoting plugin for ILIAS < 7.0 information and objects.
### Software Requirements
This LiveVoting version 8.0 requires [PHP](https://php.net) version 7.4 or 8.0.x to work properly on your ILIAS 8 platform

## Installation & Update
Please, notice that previous versions of the plugin were numbered with dates (e.g. 2021.01.01). This version is numbered with the ILIAS version it is compatible with (e.g. ilias8 -> 8.x).
**You need to change the plugin version in the il_plugin table of the database to something lower than 8.0.0 before running the following commands.**

1. **Ensure you delete any previous LiveVoting folder** in Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject/

2. Create subdirectories, if necessary for Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject/ or run the following script from the ILIAS root

```bash
mkdir -p Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject
cd Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject
```

3. Then, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surlabs/LiveVotingRW.git ./LiveVoting
cd LiveVoting
git checkout ilias8
```

Ensure you run composer install at platform root before you install/update the plugin
```bash
composer install --no-dev
```

Run ILIAS update script at platform root
```bash
php setup/setup.php update
```

**Ensure you don't ignore plugins at the ilias .gitignore files and don't use --no-plugins option at ILIAS setup**

## Configuration
If you want to use the Shortlink mode, you need to rewrite the rule in .htaccess or Apache-Config
```apacheconf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/?vote(/\w*)? /Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject/LiveVoting/pin.php?xlvo_pin=$1 [L]
</IfModule>
```
